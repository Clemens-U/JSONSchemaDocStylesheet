The goal of this project is to provide an XSL stylesheet to generate HTML documentation for any JSON Schema.

The stylesheet provided here can be applied to the JSON Schema using XML ValidatorBuddy.

The basic approach is to convert the JSON Schema to XML and apply the stylesheet. The HTML at schema_address.html is an example created using jsonschemadoc.xsl.
